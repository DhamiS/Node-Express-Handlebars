Eat-Da-Burger!

This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Node Express Handlebars
Overview
Find My Repository

I have built an application meant to log your burgers with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The app design pattern follows a MVC structure; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Instructions
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
